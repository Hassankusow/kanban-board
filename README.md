A Trello-style kanban board built as part of MyCritters' onboarding project. This full-stack application is developed using TypeScript, React, Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Apollo GraphQL with Codegen, and Nhost (Postgres + Hasura).

The project focuses on:

 1. React hooks and component design

 2. Fully-typed GraphQL queries using Apollo Client

 3. Auth, database, and realtime sync with Nhost

 4. Drag-and-drop cards/columns with live updates

 5. Production deployment to Vercel

 6. Designed to demonstrate full-stack proficiency while building a real-world, collaborative productivity app.
